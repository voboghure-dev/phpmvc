## Take your PHP Projects to the Next Level

Learning how to use an **MVC framework** puts a very powerful tool at your fingertips. Most commercial websites and web applications written in PHP use some sort of framework, and the **MVC pattern** is the most popular type of framework in use.

The gap between knowing PHP and using a framework can be huge. This practice bridges that gap. By writing your own framework from scratch, you'll gain an understanding of just how each component works. Frameworks like Laravel, Symfony and CodeIgniter all use the MVC pattern, so understanding how an MVC framework is put together will give you a strong background to learn frameworks very easily.
